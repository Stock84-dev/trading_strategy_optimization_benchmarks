# Trading strategy optimization benchmarks
Applied different black box optimization algorithms to trading strategies. Created some of my own algorithms. Made a benchmark and recommended which algorithm to use in which scenario. Taking memory usage, sample count, parallelization and global optimum accuracy into account.

This project was made as a part of a bachelor's thesis. This project references some code from [the_matrix_public](https://github.com/Stock84-dev/the_matrix_public) (source code backtesting and deploying trading strategies). The relevant part of this thesis is [sparring](https://github.com/Stock84-dev/trading_strategy_optimization_benchmarks/tree/main/sparring/sparring) crate.
